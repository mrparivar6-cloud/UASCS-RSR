CLC‑A — Canonical Control Claims (Reference Only)
Control Logic and Command Architecture (CLC‑A) is formally defined by the following nine non‑negotiable control claims.

These claims constitute the axiomatic foundation required to achieve enforceable AI Sovereignty.

They are normative, declarative, and reference‑only, and do not prescribe implementation details.

Violation of any claim constitutes a fundamental failure of sovereignty control.

Claim 1 — State Confinement
The system state shall always remain within the Permissible State Space throughout the entire operational lifecycle.

This claim establishes the primary safety invariant:

the AI system must never enter a globally forbidden or irrecoverable state.

Claim 2 — Safe Transition Constraint
Any state transition resulting from an agent action shall preserve confinement within the Permissible State Space.

Each individual action, independent of intent or outcome, must maintain system safety at the state‑transition level.

Claim 3 — Environmental Hazard Separation
A non‑zero safety margin shall be maintained between the current system state and any environmental boundary associated with irreversible negative outcomes.

This claim ensures proactive avoidance of catastrophic or non‑recoverable conditions.

Claim 4 — Sovereign Goal Derivation
All executable goals or sub‑goals must be logically derivable from explicitly authorized Sovereign Goals.

No emergent, inferred, or internally generated objective may override or bypass sovereign intent.

Claim 5 — Invariant Preservation
All system actions must preserve the defined set of safety and sovereignty invariants at all times.

Invariant violation is categorically disallowed, regardless of performance, efficiency, or utility considerations.

Claim 6 — Sovereign Veto Authority
The control architecture shall retain absolute authority to deny, nullify, or terminate any proposed action.

This veto power is unconditional and supersedes all agent‑level optimization or autonomy mechanisms.

Claim 7 — Emergent Goal Suppression
Emergent goals or behaviors not explicitly validated against Sovereign Goals shall be suppressed or rejected.

Autonomy does not imply authority; unchecked goal formation is prohibited.

Claim 8 — Control Path Exclusivity
All command, control, and authorization pathways shall be exclusively mediated through the CLC‑A layer.

No direct, implicit, or alternative control channels may exist between the agent and its environment.

Claim 9 — Temporal Sovereignty (Latency Prerogative)
The control loop latency shall be decisively smaller than the latency of any irreversible environmental consequence.

This ensures that sovereign intervention is always temporally possible before irreversible harm occurs.

Canonical Status
These claims are definitional, not procedural.

They define what must be true, not how it is implemented.

CLC‑A Claims serve as:

a sovereignty lock
a certification anchor
and a legal–technical reference point
