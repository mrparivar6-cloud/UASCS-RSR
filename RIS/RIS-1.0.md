## Canonical Reference

This document constitutes the **authoritative and canonical reference**
for the *UASCS Risk Intelligence Specification (RIS-1.0)*.

The normative definition of all risk dimensions, scoring logic, and
classification semantics associated with UASCS-RIS-1.0 is fixed and
anchored to the following DOI-registered record:

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18646908

Any interpretation, evaluation, or claim of compliance with UASCS-RIS
**must explicitly reference this specification**.

---

## Scope and Intent

RIS-1.0 defines a **formal, model-agnostic risk intelligence layer**
for the classification, disclosure, and continuous assessment of
Artificial Intelligence systems across deployment contexts.

The specification introduces:
- Normative risk dimensions and escalation logic
- A structured Risk Traceability framework
- A mathematically grounded Total Risk Score (TRS) model
- Classification semantics independent of implementation technology

RIS-1.0 is designed to operate as an **intelligence and assessment layer**
and does **not** prescribe architectural, algorithmic, or operational
implementations.

## Non-Implementation Notice

This repository provides **reference definitions only**.

No executable logic, operational workflow, or implementation guidance
is included or implied.

Any system, product, framework, or service claiming alignment,
certification, or compliance with UASCS-RIS-1.0 **requires explicit
authorization from the rights holder** and remains subject to the
licensing terms governing the canonical specification.

---

## Relationship to Control Architectures

RIS-1.0 is intentionally decoupled from control and enforcement
mechanisms.

Enforcement, mediation, and sovereignty-preserving control functions
are defined separately within the **CLC-A (Control Logic & Command
Architecture)** and are **out of scope** for this specification.

This specification is released for public reference and scholarly
citation under a **Custom License based on CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**.

Commercial use, derivative works, or implementation—direct or indirect—
are strictly prohibited without prior written authorization.
